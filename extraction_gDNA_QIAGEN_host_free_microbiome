*QIAGEN host-free microbiome gDNA extraction kit*
(also previously known as QIAGEN Tissue microbiome field test kit)
*Purpose:* This protocol is used for isolation of bacterial DNA from samples that are intrinsically rich in host DNA.
*Supplies:*
Qiagen Tissue Microbiome Field Test Kit (Cat # )
*Equipment:*
Omni Bead Ruptor 96
Thermomixer heat block
Centrifuge
End-over-end rotator
Vortex
P1000, P200 pipet tips
*Protocol:*
Things to do before starting:
[ ]Remove all components from refrigerator or freezer.
[ ]Dissolve lyophilized Dissociation Mix in 1.8ml PBS; mix by inversion, store in aliquots at -20C.
[ ]If not using a complete bottle of Buffer AHL, make sure to use sterile technique to remove the needed amount of buffer. For this step, work under laminar flow is recommended.
[ ]If a precipitate has formed in Buffer ATL or Buffer APL2, dissolve by incubation at
56°C.
[ ]Preheat heating blocks or water baths to 37°C, 56°C, and 70°C.
[ ]Ensure that Buffers AW1 and AW2 have been prepared according to the instructions on the bottle.
[ ]Before use, add 100 μl Reagent DX to 15 ml Buffer ATL. If smaller amounts are
needed, transfer 1.5 ml of Buffer ATL into a sterile 2 ml vial and add 10 μl Reagent DX. Mix well after adding Reagent DX. After preparation, the mixture is stable for 6 months at room temperature (15–25°C).
*A. Depletion of host DNA*
1. Weight 40-60 mg of lung tissue sample into a screw cap tube:
[ ]Use disposable scalpel to cut the tissue into smaller pieces on a sterile petri dish. Record weight.
2. Add the following in order to the tube:
[ ]220ul Buffer RDD
[ ]3ul Benzonase
[ ]30ul Dissociation mix
[ ]Mix well and incubate at 37C, 45min, 600RPM.
3. Add 20ul Proteinase K, mix well and incubate at 56C, 20 min, 600RPM.
4. Add 200ul Buffer ATL (containing Reagent DX); mix well and transfer to a PowerBead tube.
*B. Tissue Homogenization*
5. Secure a bead beater fitted with a 2 ml tube holder assembly and place it in the Omni
Bead Ruptor for 5 minute at 30Hz; rotate assembly and repeat.
6. Centrifuge the PowerBead tube at 10,000xg, 1 min.
7. Transfer the homogenized liquid into a new tube.
*C. Lysing bacterial cells*
8. Add 200 μl Buffer APL2. Mix by pulse vortexing for 30 s.
9. Incubate at 70°C for 10 min and briefly spin the tube.
10. Carefully apply up to 700 μl of the mixture from step 9 to the QIAamp UCP Mini Column without wetting the rim. Close the cap and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1min.
11. Discard the flow-through. Put the column back into the collection tube to repeat step 12 with any remaining mixture from step 9.
12. Transfer the QIAamp UCP Mini Column to a fresh collection tube. Carefully open the cap and add 500 μl Buffer AW1 without wetting the rim. Close the cap and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min. Place the QIAamp UCP Mini Column into a fresh 2 ml collection tube and discard the filtrate.
13. Carefully open the QIAamp UCP Mini Column and add 500 μl Buffer AW2 without wetting the rim. Centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g) for 3 min.
14. Place the QIAamp UCP Mini Column into a fresh 2 ml collection tube. Discard the filtrate. Centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g) for 1 min.
15. Place the QIAamp UCP Mini Column into a fresh 1.5 ml tube and apply 25 μl Buffer AVE directly onto the center of the membrane. Close the lid and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.
Optional: Depending on the downstream application, water or Buffer EB may be used instead.
16. Centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min to elute the DNA.
17. Repeat step 15, 16 to obtain the total of 50 μl DNA.
Quantitate DNA by Qubit.
