# **NEBNext Microbiome DNA Enrichment kit**

**Purpose:** This protocol facilitates enrichment of microbial DNA from samples containing methylated host DNA (including human), by selective binding and removal of the CpG-methylated host DNA. Importantly, microbial diversity remains intact after enrichment.

## **Protocol:**
Follow procedures for working in low biomass lab including: UV, bleach and ethanol treatment of surfaces and equipment, handling of samples in a PCR hood, keeping caps closed.

Things to do before starting:

[ ] 1. Remove all components from refrigerator or freezer.

[ ] 2. Prepare 1X Bind/wash Buffer on ice by diluting 1 part NEBNext Bind/wash Buffer (5X) with 4 parts DNase-free water. For 10 ml, add 2 ml of NEBNext Bind/wash Buffer (5X) to 8 ml of DNase-free water. Keep the 1X Buffer cold.

[ ] 3. Bring AmpureXP beads to room temperature.

[ ] 4. Prepare fresh 80% Ethanol.


**A. Prebind MBD2-Fc Protein to Magnetic Beads**

[ ] 1. Resuspend NEBNext Protein A Magnetic Beads by gently pipetting the slurry up and down until the suspension is homogeneous. Alternatively, rotate the tube on a rotating mixer gently for 15 minutes at 4°C. Do not vortex.

[ ] 2. In one tube, add 16 μl of MBD2-Fc protein and 160 μl of Protein A Magnetic Beads.

[ ] 3. Mix the bead-protein mixture by placing the tube in a rotating mixer for 10 minutes at room temperature.

[ ] 4. Briefly spin the tube and place on the magnetic rack for 2–5 minutes or until the beads have collected to the wall of the tube and the solution is clear.

[ ] 5. Carefully pipette off the supernatant without disturbing the beads.

[ ] 6. Add 1 ml of cold 1X Bind/wash Buffer to the tube to wash the beads. Pipette up and down until the beads are completely homogeneous, at least 5-10 times.

[ ] 7. Mix the beads on a rotating mixer for 3 minutes at room temperature.

[ ] 8. Briefly spin the tube and place on the magnetic rack for 2–5 minutes or until the beads have collected to the wall of the tube and the solution is clear.

[ ] 9. Carefully pipette off the supernatant without disturbing the beads.

[ ] 10. Repeat steps 6-9.

[ ] 11. Remove the tube from the rack and add 160 μl of cold 1X Bind/wash Buffer to resuspend the beads.

[ ] 12. The MBD2-Fc-bound magnetic beads are stable for up to 7 days at 4°C.

**B. Capture Methylated Host DNA onto the Beads and Collect Enriched Microbial DNA**

[ ] 1. Add two empty tubes, one at beginning and one at end, for enrichment controls; treat as samples but without DNA added. Add ~30 ng of DNA extract to each sample tube plus 5 μl of MBD2-Fc-bound magnetic beads prepared in part A.

[ ] 2. Add undiluted Bind/wash Buffer (5X) for a final concentration of 1X:
    Volume of 5X Bind/wash Buffer to add (μl) = Vol input DNA (μl)/4

[ ] 3. Agitate the tube on a rotating mixer for 15 minutes at room temperature.

[ ] 4. Briefly spin the tube and place on the magnetic rack for 5 minutes until the beads have collected to the wall of the tube and the solution is clear.

[ ] 5. Carefully pipette off the supernatant without disturbing the beads and transfer it to a clean microcentrifuge tube. This supernatant contains the target microbial DNA. Store this sample at –20°C or proceed directly to clean up (Part C).


**C. AMPure XP Bead Cleanup**

[ ] 1. Vortex AMPure XP Beads to resuspend thoroughly.

[ ] 2. Add 1.8X volume of resuspended AMPure XP beads to the sample. Mix well by pipetting up and down at least 10 times. Be careful to expel all of the liquid out of the tip during the last mix. 

[ ] 3. Incubate samples for at least 5 minutes at room temperature.

[ ] 4. Place the tube on the magnetic stand to separate the beads from the supernatant. If necessary, quickly spin the sample to collect the liquid from the sides of the tube or plate wells before placing on the magnetic stand.

[ ] 5. After 5 minutes (or when the solution is clear), carefully remove and discard the supernatant. Be careful not to disturb the beads that contain DNA targets.

[ ] 6. Add 400 μl of freshly prepared 80% ethanol to the tube/plate while in the magnetic stand. Incubate at room temperature for 30 seconds, and then carefully remove and discard the supernatant. Be careful not to disturb the beads that contain DNA targets.

[ ] 7. Repeat Step 6 once for a total of two washes. Be sure to remove all visible liquid after the second wash. If necessary, briefly spin the tube, place back on the magnetic stand and remove traces of ethanol with a P10 pipette tip.

[ ] 8. Remove the tube from the magnetic stand. Elute the DNA target from the beads by adding 20 μl of nuclease-free water.

[ ] 9. Mix the beads thoroughly in water by pipetting up and down 10 times or until they are homogeneous. Incubate for at least 2 minutes at room temperature. If necessary, quickly spin the sample to collect the liquid from the sides of the tube or plate wells before placing back on the magnetic stand.

[ ] 10. Place the tube/plate on the magnetic stand. After 5 minutes (or when the solution is clear), transfer eluate to a new microcentrifuge tube. The sample can now be used for downstream analysis.
