# **QIAGEN QIAamp DNA Microbiome kit**

**Purpose:** This protocol is used for isolation of bacterial DNA from tissue samples. This kit has been used to successfully extract microbiome DNA from human lung (40-60mg). It is recommended to follow this protocol with a [host depletion step](DNA_extraction/enrichment_gDNA_NEBNext_Microbiome_DNA_Enrichment_Kit.md) prior to 16S and ITS amplicon PCR.

**Supplies:**

## **Protocol:**
Follow procedures for working in low biomass lab including: UV, bleach and ethanol treatment of surfaces and equipment, handling of samples in a PCR hood, keeping caps closed.

Things to do before starting:

[ ] 1. Remove all components from refrigerator or freezer.

[ ] 2. If not using a complete bottle of Buffer AHL, make sure to use sterile technique to remove the needed amount of buffer. 

[ ] 3. If a precipitate has formed in Buffer ATL or Buffer APL2, dissolve by incubation at 56°C.

[ ] 4. Preheat heating blocks to 37°C, 56°C, and 70°C.

[ ] 5. Ensure that Buffers AW1 and AW2 have been prepared according to the instructions on the bottle.

[ ] 6. Before use, add 100 μl Reagent DX to 15 ml Buffer ATL. If smaller amounts are needed, transfer 1.5 ml of Buffer ATL into a sterile 2 ml vial and add 10 μl Reagent DX. Mix well after adding Reagent DX. After preparation, the mixture is stable for 6 months at room temperature (15–25°C).

**A. Tissue Homogenization**

[ ] 1. Weigh up to 60 mg of tissue, use disposable scalpel to cut the tissue into smaller pieces on a sterile petri dish. Record weight and place into a ZR Bashing bead lysis tube.

[ ] 2. Add 750 ml of Zymo Elution buffer to the tube.

[ ] 3. Secure a bead beater fitted with a 2 ml tube holder assembly and place it in the Omni Bead Ruptor for 1 minute at 30Hz.

[ ] 4. Carefully transfer the homogenized liquid into a new screw cap tube.

**B. Depletion of host DNA**

[ ] 1. Add 375 ml Buffer AHL to the sample tube and incubate for 30 min at room temperature with end-over-end rotation.

[ ] 2. Centrifuge the tube at 10,000xg, 10 min and carefully remove the supernatant. Do not disturb the pellet as this will result in loss of bacterial material.

[ ] 3. Add 190 μl Buffer RDD and 2.5 μl Benzonase. Mix well and incubate at 37°C for 30 min at 600 rpm in a thermomixer.

[ ] 4. Remove the tubes and raise the thermomixer to 56°C.

[ ] 5. Add 20ul Proteinase K, mix well and incubate at 56C, 30 min, 600RPM.

[ ] 6. Briefly spin the tube at slow speed to pull down condensation. 

[ ] 7. Add 200ul Buffer ATL (containing Reagent DX); mix well to avoid loss of sample material and transfer into a Pathogen Lysis Tube S (or Pathogen Lysis Tube L)

**Note: Careful mixing after the centrifugation step ensures efficient transfer of intact bacteria.**

**C. Lysing bacterial cells**

[ ] 1. Secure lysis tubes in a bead beater assembly fitted with a 2 ml tube holder and place it in the Omni Bead Ruptor for 1 min at 30Hz; rest for 5 min and repeat twice for a total of 3 min bead beating.

[ ] 2. Centrifuge the lysis tubes at 10,000 x g for 1 min to reduce the amount of foam after lysis. 

[ ] 3. Mix carefully and transfer the supernatant to a fresh screw cap tube.

**Note: Careful mixing after the centrifugation step will transfer possibly intact bacteria that are at the bottom of the tube. Do not transfer beads from the Pathogen Lysis Tube to subsequent reactions.**

[ ] 4. Add 40 μl Proteinase K, mix by vortexing, and incubate at 56°C for 30 min at 600 rpm in a thermomixer.

[ ] 5. Remove the tubes and raise the thermomixer to 70°C.

[ ] 6. Add 200 μl Buffer APL2. Mix by pulse vortexing for 30 s.

[ ] 7. Incubate at 70°C for 10 min and briefly spin the tube.

[ ] 8. Add 200 μl ethanol to the lysate. Mix thoroughly by pulse vortexing for 15–30 s.

[ ] 9. Carefully apply up to 700 μl of the mixture from step 8 to the QIAamp UCP Mini Column without wetting the rim. Close the cap and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1min.

[ ] 10. Discard the flow-through. Put the column back into the collection tube and repeat step 9 with any remaining mixture from step 8.

[ ] 11. Transfer the QIAamp UCP Mini Column to a fresh collection tube. Carefully open the cap and add 500 μl Buffer AW1 without wetting the rim. Close the cap and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min. 

[ ] 12. Place the QIAamp UCP Mini Column into a fresh 2 ml collection tube and discard the filtrate.

[ ] 13. Carefully open the QIAamp UCP Mini Column and add 500 μl Buffer AW2 without wetting the rim. Centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g) for 3 min.

[ ] 14. Place the QIAamp UCP Mini Column into a fresh 2 ml collection tube. Discard the filtrate. Centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g) for 1 min.

[ ] 15. Place the QIAamp UCP Mini Column into a fresh 1.5 ml tube and apply 25 μl nuclease-free water directly onto the center of the membrane. Close the lid and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.

[ ] 16. Centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min to elute the DNA.

[ ] 17. Repeat steps 15 and 16 to obtain the total elution of 50 μl DNA.

[ ] 18. Quantitate DNA by Qubit.
