# **Zymo HostZERO Microbial DNA kit**

**Purpose:** This protocol is used for isolation of bacterial DNA. Bead beating with 2.0 mm beads will mostly lyse tissue and host cells while preserving microbial cells.

**Supplies:**

**Equipment:**

- Omni Bead Ruptor 96
- Thermomixer heat block
- Microcentrifuge
- End-over-end rotator
- Vortex
- P1000, P200 , P20, P2 pipettors

## **Protocol:**
Follow procedures for working in low biomass lab including: UV, bleach and ethanol treatment of surfaces and equipment, handling of samples in a PCR hood, keeping caps closed.

Things to do before starting:

[ ] 1. Remove all components from -20C keeping enzymes in ice block; Host depletion solution and Microbial selection buffer need to thaw.

2. Reconstitute lyophilized Proteinase K at 20 mg/ml with Proteinase K Storage Buffer and mix by vortexing. Store in aliquots at -20C.

    [ ] For #D3001-2-20 (20 mg), add 1.04 ml buffer.

    [ ] #D3001-2-5 (5 mg), add 0.26 ml buffer.

[ ] 3. Preheat heating blocks to 37°C and 55°C.

**A. Prepare solid tissue samples**

[ ] 1. Weigh up to 125 mg of tissue, use disposable scalpel to cut the tissue into smaller pieces on a sterile petri dish. Record weight and place into a ZR BashingBead lysis tube (2.0mm).

[ ] 2. Add 750ul DNA Elution Buffer.

[ ] 3. Secure in a bead beater and process at at 30Hz for 1 min.

[ ] 4. Centrifuge at ≥16,000 x g for 2 min.

[ ] 5. Without disturbing the pellet, carefully remove the supernatant and discard.


**B. Depletion of host DNA**

[ ] 1. Add 1 ml Host DNA Depletion Solution to sample in the lysis tube and resuspend the pellet mixing well; transfer to a new microcentrifuge tube

[ ] 2. Rotate sample for 15 minutes using end-over-end rotation at room temperature (20-30ºC).

[ ] 3. Centrifuge the tube at 10,000 x g for 5 minutes.

[ ] 4. Without disturbing the pellet, carefully remove and discard the supernatant.

[ ] 5. Add 100 µl of Microbial Selection Buffer to the tube and resuspend the pellet.

[ ] 6. Add 1 µl of Microbial Selection Enzyme to the suspension. Vortex briefly to mix.

[ ] 7. Incubate the tube at 37°C for 30 minutes.

[ ] 8. Turn heat block up to 55°C.

[ ] 9. Add 20 µl of Proteinase K to the sample and vortex for at least 10 seconds. 

[ ] 10. Incubate at 55°C for 10 minutes.

[ ] 11. Add 100 µl of DNA/RNA Shield (2X Concentrate) to the sample and vortex for at least 10 seconds. 

[ ] 12. Incubate at room temperature (20-30ºC) for 5 minutes.

*Proceed to Microbial DNA isolation or store sample at -80°C.*

**C. Microbial DNA isolation**

*Perform all steps at room temperature and centrifugation at 10,000-16,000 x g for 30 seconds, unless specified.*

[ ] 1. Add the entire sample from the end of Host DNA Depletion to a ZR BashingBead Lysis Tube (0.1 & 0.5 mm). 

[ ] 2. Add 750 µl of Lysis Solution to the tube and cap tightly.

[ ] 3. Secure in a bead beater and process at 30Hz for 1 min; rest 5 min; repeat 2 more times for a total of 3 bead beatings.

[ ] 4. Centrifuge at ≥10,000 x g for 1 minute.

[ ] 5. Transfer 400 µl of supernatant to a Collection Tube.

[ ] 6. Add 1200 µl of DNA Binding Buffer to the supernatant in the Collection Tube and mix well.

[ ] 7. Transfer the supernatant from Step 6 to a Zymo-Spin IC-Z Column in a Collection Tube and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through; repeat for remaining supernatant.

[ ] 8. Add 400 µl of DNA Wash Buffer 1 to the column in a new Collection Tube and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.

[ ] 9. Add 700 µl of DNA Wash Buffer 2 to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.

[ ] 10. Add 200 µl of DNA Wash Buffer 2 and centrifuge the column for 1 minute to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer. Then carefully, transfer the column into a clean microcentrifuge tube.

[ ] 11. Add 20 µl of DNase/RNase-Free Water directly to the column matrix and incubate for 5 minutes. Centrifuge at full speed for 1 minute to elute the DNA. The DNA is now suitable for PCR and other downstream applications.

[ ] 12. Quantitate DNA by Qubit.
