# **QIAGEN host-free microbiome gDNA extraction kit**
(also previously known as QIAGEN Tissue microbiome field test kit)

**Purpose:** This protocol is used for isolation of bacterial DNA from samples that are intrinsically rich in host DNA. This kit has been used to successfully extract microbiome DNA from human lung (40-60mg) and colorectal punch biopsy (1 punch). The resulting DNA is suitable for 16S and ITS amplicon PCR.

**Supplies:**

| QIAamp DNA Host-Free Microbiome Kit    | Qiagen      | [(Cat #51904)](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/microbial-dna/qiaamp-dna-host-free-microbiome) |  

**Equipment:**

- Omni Bead Ruptor 96
- Thermomixer heat block
- Microcentrifuge
- End-over-end rotator
- Vortex
- P1000, P200 , P20, P2 pipettors

## **Protocol:**
Follow procedures for working in low biomass lab including: UV, bleach and ethanol treatment of surfaces and equipment, handling of samples in a PCR hood, keeping caps closed.

Things to do before starting:

[ ] 1. Remove all components from refrigerator or freezer.

[ ] 2. Dissolve lyophilized Dissociation Mix in 1.8ml PBS; mix by inversion, store in aliquots at -20C.

[ ] 3. If not using a complete bottle of Buffer AHL, make sure to use sterile technique to remove the needed amount of buffer. 

[ ] 4. If a precipitate has formed in Buffer ATL or Buffer APL2, dissolve by incubation at 56°C.

[ ] 5. Preheat heating blocks or water baths to 37°C, 56°C, and 70°C.

[ ] 6. Ensure that Buffers AW1 and AW2 have been prepared according to the instructions on the bottle.

[ ] 7. Before use, add 100 μl Reagent DX to 15 ml Buffer ATL. If smaller amounts are needed, transfer 1.5 ml of Buffer ATL into a sterile 2 ml vial and add 10 μl Reagent DX. Mix well after adding Reagent DX. After preparation, the mixture is stable for 6 months at room temperature (15–25°C).

**A. Depletion of host DNA**

[ ] 1. Weigh up to 60 mg of tissue, use disposable scalpel to cut the tissue into smaller pieces on a sterile petri dish. Record weight and place into a screw cap tube.

2. Add the following in order to the tube:

  [ ]220ul Buffer RDD
  
  [ ]3ul Benzonase
  
  [ ]30ul Dissociation mix
  
  [ ]Mix well and incubate at 37C, 45min, 600RPM.
  
[ ] 3. Add 20ul Proteinase K, mix well and incubate at 56C, 20 min, 600RPM.

[ ] 4. Add 200ul Buffer ATL (containing Reagent DX); mix well and transfer to a PowerBead tube.

**B. Tissue Homogenization**

[ ] 1. Secure a bead beater fitted with a 2 ml tube holder assembly and place it in the Omni Bead Ruptor for 5 minute at 30Hz; rotate assembly and repeat.

[ ] 2. Centrifuge the PowerBead tube at 10,000xg, 1 min.

[ ] 3. Transfer the homogenized liquid into a new tube being careful to not carry over beads.

**C. Lysing bacterial cells**

[ ] 1. Add 200 μl Buffer APL2. Mix by pulse vortexing for 30 s.

[ ] 2. Incubate at 70°C for 10 min and briefly spin the tube.

[ ] 3. Carefully apply up to 700 μl of the mixture from step 9 to the QIAamp UCP Mini Column without wetting the rim. Close the cap and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1min.

[ ] 4. Discard the flow-through. Put the column back into the collection tube and repeat above step with any remaining mixture.

[ ] 5. Transfer the QIAamp UCP Mini Column to a fresh collection tube. Carefully open the cap and add 500 μl Buffer AW1 without wetting the rim. Close the cap and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min. Place the QIAamp UCP Mini Column into a fresh 2 ml collection tube and discard the filtrate.

[ ] 6. Carefully open the QIAamp UCP Mini Column and add 500 μl Buffer AW2 without wetting the rim. Centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g) for 3 min.

[ ] 7. Place the QIAamp UCP Mini Column into a fresh 2 ml collection tube. Discard the filtrate. Centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g) for 1 min.

[ ] 8. Place the QIAamp UCP Mini Column into a fresh 1.5 ml tube and apply 25 μl Buffer AVE directly onto the center of the membrane. Close the lid and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.

Optional: Depending on the downstream application, water or Buffer EB may be used instead.

[ ] 9. Centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min to elute the DNA.

[ ] 10. Repeat elution step to obtain the total of 50 μl DNA.

[ ] 11. Quantitate DNA by Qubit.
