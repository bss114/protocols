# **Zymo Quick DNA Fecal/Soil Microbe Miniprep kit**

**Purpose:** This protocol is designed for the simple and rapid isolation of inhibitor-free, PCR-quality host cell and microbial DNA from a variety of sample sources. In most instances, mitochondrial DNA and viral DNA (if present) will also be recovered. A [host-depletion step](DNA_extraction/enrichment_gDNA_NEBNext_Microbiome_DNA_Enrichment_Kit.md) is recommended prior to microbiome sequencing.
Human lung samples (40-60mg) were processed using this kit and subsequently characterized for 16S; results indicate that host-depletion is necessary.

**Equipment:**

- Microcentrifuge
- Vortex
- P1000, P200 , P20, P2 pipettors

## **Protocol:**

Things to do before starting:

[ ] 1. Add B-mercaptoethanol to the Genomic Lysis buffer (500ul per 100ml)


**A. Tissue Homogenization**

[ ] 1. Add two empty tubes, one at beginning and one at end, for extraction controls; treat as samples but without tissue added. Add ≤ 120 mg tissue sample to a ZR BashingBead™ Lysis tube (2mm).  

[ ] 2. Add 750 µl BashingBead™ Buffer.

[ ] 3. Secure in a bead beater and run for 1 min at 30Hz.

[ ] 4. Centrifuge at ≥ 10,000 x g for 1 min.

**B. Isolation of genomic DNA**

[ ] 1. Transfer up to 400 µl supernatant to a Zymo-Spin™ III-F Filter in a Collection Tube.

[ ] 2. Centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 1 min.

[ ] 3. Add 1200 µl of Genomic Lysis Buffer to the filtrate, mix well.

[ ] 4. Transfer 800 µl of the mixture to a Zymo-Spin™ IICR Column in a Collection Tube.

[ ] 5. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 min.

[ ] 6. Discard the flow through.

[ ] 7. Repeat, adding the remaining mixture to the column and centrifuge 10,000 x g for 1 min.

[ ] 8. Place the column in a new Collection Tube, add 200 µl DNA Pre-Wash Buffer to the column.

[ ] 9. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 min.

[ ] 10. Add 500 µl g-DNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 min.

[ ] 11. Transfer the column to a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and add 50 µl DNA Elution Buffer directly to the column matrix.

[ ] 12. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 seconds to elute the DNA.

[ ] 13. Place a Zymo-Spin™ III-HRC Filter in a clean Collection Tube and add 600 µl Prep Solution. 

[ ] 14. Centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 3 mins.

[ ] 15. Transfer the eluted DNA to a prepared Zymo-Spin™ III-HRC Filter in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at exactly 16,000 x g for 3 mins.

[ ] 16. Assess DNA concentration by Qubit.
