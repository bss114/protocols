# **QIAGEN host-free microbiome gDNA extraction kit**
(also previously known as QIAGEN Tissue microbiome field test kit)

**Purpose:** This protocol is used for isolation of bacterial DNA from samples that are intrinsically rich in host DNA.

**Supplies:**
Qiagen QIAamp DNA Host-Free Microbiome Kit [(Cat #51904)](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/microbial-dna/qiaamp-dna-host-free-microbiome)

**Equipment:**

Omni Bead Ruptor 96

Thermomixer heat block

Microcentrifuge

End-over-end rotator

Vortex

P1000, P200 , P20, P2 pipettors

## **Protocol:**
Follow procedures for working in low biomass lab including: UV, bleach and ethanol treatment of surfaces and equipment, handling of samples in a PCR hood, keeping caps closed.

Things to do before starting:

[ ]Remove all components from refrigerator or freezer.

[ ]Dissolve lyophilized Dissociation Mix in 1.8ml PBS; mix by inversion, store in aliquots at -20C.

[ ]If not using a complete bottle of Buffer AHL, make sure to use sterile technique to remove the needed amount of buffer. 

[ ]If a precipitate has formed in Buffer ATL or Buffer APL2, dissolve by incubation at 56°C.

[ ]Preheat heating blocks or water baths to 37°C, 56°C, and 70°C.

[ ]Ensure that Buffers AW1 and AW2 have been prepared according to the instructions on the bottle.

[ ]Before use, add 100 μl Reagent DX to 15 ml Buffer ATL. If smaller amounts are needed, transfer 1.5 ml of Buffer ATL into a sterile 2 ml vial and add 10 μl Reagent DX. Mix well after adding Reagent DX. After preparation, the mixture is stable for 6 months at room temperature (15–25°C).

**A. Depletion of host DNA**

[ ] Weigh 40-60 mg of lung tissue, use disposable scalpel to cut the tissue into smaller pieces on a sterile petri dish. Record weight and place into a screw cap tube.

Add the following in order to the tube:

  [ ]220ul Buffer RDD
  
  [ ]3ul Benzonase
  
  [ ]30ul Dissociation mix
  
  [ ]Mix well and incubate at 37C, 45min, 600RPM.
  
[ ] Add 20ul Proteinase K, mix well and incubate at 56C, 20 min, 600RPM.

[ ] Add 200ul Buffer ATL (containing Reagent DX); mix well and transfer to a PowerBead tube.

**B. Tissue Homogenization**

[ ] Secure a bead beater fitted with a 2 ml tube holder assembly and place it in the Omni Bead Ruptor for 5 minute at 30Hz; rotate assembly and repeat.

[ ] Centrifuge the PowerBead tube at 10,000xg, 1 min.

[ ] Transfer the homogenized liquid into a new tube being careful to not carry over beads.

**C. Lysing bacterial cells**

[ ] Add 200 μl Buffer APL2. Mix by pulse vortexing for 30 s.

[ ] Incubate at 70°C for 10 min and briefly spin the tube.

[ ] Carefully apply up to 700 μl of the mixture from step 9 to the QIAamp UCP Mini Column without wetting the rim. Close the cap and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1min.

[ ] Discard the flow-through. Put the column back into the collection tube and repeat above step with any remaining mixture.

[ ] Transfer the QIAamp UCP Mini Column to a fresh collection tube. Carefully open the cap and add 500 μl Buffer AW1 without wetting the rim. Close the cap and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min. Place the QIAamp UCP Mini Column into a fresh 2 ml collection tube and discard the filtrate.

[ ] Carefully open the QIAamp UCP Mini Column and add 500 μl Buffer AW2 without wetting the rim. Centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g) for 3 min.

[ ] Place the QIAamp UCP Mini Column into a fresh 2 ml collection tube. Discard the filtrate. Centrifuge at full speed (20,000 x g) for 1 min.

[ ] Place the QIAamp UCP Mini Column into a fresh 1.5 ml tube and apply 25 μl Buffer AVE directly onto the center of the membrane. Close the lid and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.

Optional: Depending on the downstream application, water or Buffer EB may be used instead.

[ ] Centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 1 min to elute the DNA.

[ ] Repeat elution step to obtain the total of 50 μl DNA.

[ ] Quantitate DNA by Qubit.
